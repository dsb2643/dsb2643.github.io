        <p>Using the low-income zip codes by counties as a baseline, I conducted research to identify the number of youth ages 10-15 and ages 16-24 residing in those areas. The data I gathered, along with my finished map projects, have been placed in the completed folder. I created heat maps to show population density, including separate heat maps for the age groups 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, and all youth ages in low-income areas.</p>

        <p>Using the low-income zip codes from the prior project as a baseline, I researched and identified areas within those zip codes that lack nonprofit resources. I created maps to visualize this data and placed the data and completed map projects in the completed folder. The analysis revealed that the East/Central regions had more low-income zip codes without nonprofit resources, while the West had fewer.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This project aimed to identify Texas counties most vulnerable to hurricanes based on their geographical location and population size.</p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning and Exploration</h3>
        <p>Our team began by importing and cleaning GIS data on Texas counties, removing duplicates and missing values. We then analyzed the latitude and longitude coordinates to assess each county's geographical positioning.</p>
        
            <h3>Hurricane-Prone Zones</h3>
        <p>We found that hurricane-prone zones lie between latitudes 5-30. We visualized this through scatter plots, highlighting counties in this range. Notably, these counties are primarily in southern Texas.</p>
        
<img width="626" alt="Texas Hurricane Impact" src="https://github.com/daniellebalque/images/raw/main/map7.png">

        <h3>Joint Plots and Clustering</h3>
        <p>To delve deeper into the spatial distribution of Texas counties, we created joint plots to visualize relationships between latitude and longitude coordinates. These plots offer insights into how counties are geographically clustered.</p>

        <h4>Northeast Clustering </h4>
        <p>The visualizations show that counties are densely clustered in the northeastern regions, which are generally outside of the hurricane-prone zones.</p>

        <h4>Coastal Distribution </h4>
        <p>In contrast, counties along coastal regions exhibit a more dispersed distribution, aligning with the hurricane-prone zone findings.</p>
        
        <h4>Density Representations </h4>
        <p>The joint plots use color gradations to indicate clustering density. Darker regions show areas where data points are more densely packed, while lighter regions reflect sparser distributions.</p>

        <p>We also analyzed population data to assess which counties had the highest populations and intersected with hurricane-prone zones. The top ten counties by population were visualized, with four of these counties also being in the hurricane-prone zone: Bexar,

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This project explores the relationship between linguistic patterns and the offender status of characters in crime TV shows, applying a psychological perspective to analyze their language and deception. The research collected dialogues from 10 different TV shows, analyzing them with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software. This study aimed to uncover correlations between language features and offender status to contribute to a nuanced understanding of crime TV dramas and their portrayal of culprits.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
        <p>The project selected 10 TV shows from IMDb’s top 50 list, focusing on crime-solving dramas. Dialogues from these shows were manually extracted and analyzed using the LIWC tool to identify linguistic characteristics of culprits and innocent characters. This data was then fed into a linear regression model, achieving an R-squared value of 1.0, while a logistic regression model reached an accuracy rate of 54.5%.</p>

    <h4>Initial Data:</h4>
        <h4>Culprits Data</h4>

        <h4>Innocents Data</h4>

        <h4>LIWC Data:</h4>

        <img src="https://github.com/daniellebalque/images/raw/main/liwc2.png">



        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p>The correlation analysis showed that characters exhibiting angry or sad emotions were more likely to be labeled as culprits, while those demonstrating logical or positive tones were less likely to be culprits. This highlights significant linguistic differences between culprits and innocent characters, contributing to understanding the portrayal of crime in media..</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/daniellebalque/images/raw/main/res.png">  

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While the project’s findings demonstrate valuable insights into linguistic patterns associated with offenders in crime TV shows, it also acknowledges limitations, including the inconsistency of word count methods and their inability to capture contextual nuances. Further research could refine these models, expanding understanding of linguistic and psychological dimensions in crime TV dramas and their impact on media representation.</p>

        <p>Eben, the owner of a local plant shop called Terracotta, surveyed former, current, and even prospective customers who visited his shop to better understand their buying patterns and preferences. He’s has asked my team in the Global Accelerator Career program to analyze the survey data and provide data-driven recommendations to make sure he really nails a pivot from a brick and mortar storefront to an online-only plant shop. Based on the survey data analysis for Terracotta plant shop, the top three types of plants most frequently purchased by customers are low-maintenance plants, indoor plants, and succulents and cacti. Additionally, the primary factors influencing customers' purchasing decisions are care requirements, pet-friendly or safe for children, and benefits. These insights suggest that customers prioritize ease of care, safety, and the benefits of the plants when making their purchasing decisions. To successfully make this transition, Eben should focus on promoting these popular plant types and highlighting the key factors that influence customer purchases.</p>

        <p>The UNDP Accelerator Labs, launched by the United Nations Development Programme in 2019, aim to accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through innovative grassroots solutions. The UNDP calls for powerful yet easy-to-understand visualizations of discovered energy solutions to advocate for a sustainable future. Using the provided Tableau Cloud workbook, my team created visualizations to showcase the prevalence of various energy sources, their regional differences, and their impact, helping to highlight the value of these grassroots innovations.</p>
